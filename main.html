                <h2>#1 Fill up on Fiber</h2>
                <p>Fiber is found in healthy foods including vegetables, fruits, beans and whole grains.
                    Some studies have shown that simply eating more fiber-rich foods may help you lose weight and keep it off.
                    Increasing your intake is as easy as adding beans to your salad, eating oats for breakfast or snacking on fiber-rich nuts and seeds.</p>

                <h2>#2 Ditch Added Sugar</h2>
                <p>Added sugar, especially from sugary drinks, is a major reason for unhealthy weight gain and health problems like diabetes and heart disease.
                    Plus, foods like candy, soda and baked goods that contain lots of added sugars tend to be very low in the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy. 
                    Cutting out foods high in added sugars is a great way to lose excess weight.  
                    It's important to note that even foods promoted as “healthy” or “organic” can be very high in sugar. Therefore, reading nutrition labels is a must.</p>

                <h2>#3 Make Room for Healthy Fat</h2>
                <p>While fat is often the first thing that gets cut when you're trying to slim down, healthy fats can actually help you reach your weight loss goals.
                    In fact, following a high-fat diet that's rich in foods like olive oil, avocados and nuts has been shown to maximize weight loss in several studies.
                    What's more, fats help you stay fuller for longer, decreasing cravings and helping you stay on track.</p>

                <h2>#4 Minimize Distractions</h2>
                <p>While consuming meals in front of your TV or computer may not seem like diet sabotage, eating while distracted may cause you to consume more calories and gain weight.
                    Eating at the dinner table, away from potential distractions, is not only a good way to keep your weight down — it also allows you time to reconnect with loved ones.
                    Smartphones are another device you should set aside while you're eating. Scrolling through emails or your Instagram or Facebook feed is just as distracting as a TV or computer.</p>
