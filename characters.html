      <p>Rachel Greene is the spoiled but warm-hearted and likeable daughter of a rich vascular surgeon and his wife. Rachel is introduced into the series in the first episode after she leaves her fiancé, Barry, at the altar, and attempts to live independently without financial support from her parents. She flees from her almost-wedding to New York City to find Monica Geller, her friend from high school. Rachel moves into Monica's apartment and meets Phoebe Buffay, and Joey Tribbiani. Rachel already knows Ross Geller, Monica's brother, as all three went to the same high school and also Chandler Bing as he was Ross's college buddy. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at Central Perk coffee house. She later begins to work in fashion, becoming an assistant buyer, and later a personal shopper, at Bloomingdale's. She eventually becomes a buyer at Polo Ralph Lauren. A great deal of Rachel's life throughout the series revolves around her relationship with Ross Geller.</p>

      <section class="textCharacters">
        <p>Phoebe Buffay is an odd, ditzy albeit sweet-natured masseuse who grew up homeless, sometimes telling her friends outlandish tales of life on the street. She is an aspiring musician who plays the guitar and sings songs with somewhat unusual lyrics at the coffee shop. She has an identical twin sister, Ursula (also played by Kudrow), who is just as odd as Phoebe and appeared as a recurring character on Mad About You. After a series of dates and relationships with a number of men, Phoebe meets Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) in season nine, whom she eventually marries in season ten. She also became a surrogate mother for her half-brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi), giving birth to his triplets in the fifth season.</p>

        <p>Joey Tribbiani is a good-natured but not-so-bright struggling actor and food lover, who becomes mildly famous for his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on a fictionalized version of Days of Our Lives. Joey is a womanizer, with many girlfriends throughout the series, often using his catchphrase pick-up line "How you doin'?" He develops a crush on Rachel in season eight but nothing happens until Rachel falls for Joey at the end of season nine. They date for about a week, becoming official in Barbados but they end the relationship because they can never be more than best friends. Matt Le Blanc got a spin off show called Joey once the series finished because Joey's character didn't have a resolute ending.</p>

        <img src="imagesFriends/chandler.jpg" alt="a picture with Chandler Bing">
      </aside>
      <section class="textCharacters">
        <p>Chandler Bing is an executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large multi-national corporation, a job which he despises. Because of this, Chandler later quits his job and becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor. An intelligent man at the end of the day (despite all his goofy quirkiness), he often mocks his best friend Joey for the latter's stupidity. Chandler is often depicted as being somewhat of a hapless individual, suffering a lot of bad luck while struggling through life and occasionally struggling with an on-and-off smoking addiction.</p>

      <section class="textCharactersRoss">
        <p>Ross Geller is a paleontologist at a museum of prehistory, and later a professor of paleontology at New York University. The most intelligent of the six main characters, but at the same time a clumsy, quirky man, Ross is known for being a know-it-all who prides himself on his rationality, despite his clear hopeless romanticism. Monica's older brother, Chandler's college roommate, and Rachel's on-again, off-again boyfriend, Ross has three failed marriages during the series (including a drunken marriage to Rachel in Las Vegas) and is involved in an on-and-off relationship with Rachel, which is a main storyline throughout the series. </p>
